Polynomial Calculator
This is a simple polynomial calculator program that allows users to create and manipulate polynomials through a graphical user interface (GUI).

Features
Create polynomials with various coefficients and degrees.
Perform mathematical operations on polynomials such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration.
View the resulting polynomial after performing an operation.
How to Use
Enter the coefficients and exponents of the polynomials in the designated input fields.
Select the desired operation from the menu.
Click the corresponding button to perform the operation.
The result will be displayed in the GUI.
Implementation
The program follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It consists of three main components:

Polynomial class: Represents a polynomial and provides methods for performing operations on polynomials.
Controller class: Handles user input and updates the GUI based on the chosen operation.
GUI class: Displays the GUI and receives user input.
Testing
The program includes test cases to ensure the correct functionality of the Polynomial class. The tests cover addition and subtraction operations with different polynomial inputs.

Conclusion
This polynomial calculator program provides a user-friendly interface for creating and manipulating polynomials. It can be extended to support additional mathematical operations and functionalities in the future.
